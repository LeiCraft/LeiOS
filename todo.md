Creating your own Debian fork with custom OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience) configurations—like KDE settings, preinstalled packages, or branding—is entirely doable. It’s essentially what distros like **MX Linux**, **KDE neon**, or **Tails** do. The process depends on how deeply you want to customize it: from a “Debian remix” (using tools to build a modified ISO) to a fully automated custom distribution with your own repos.

Let’s walk through the modern, practical approach for what you’re describing — **a Debian-based distro with custom defaults and OOBE setup**.

---

### 🧰 1. Set up your build environment

You’ll need a clean Debian (or Debian-like) system to build from.
Install basic tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install live-build debootstrap squashfs-tools xorriso
```

* **live-build**: creates bootable Debian Live ISO images.
* **debootstrap**: bootstraps a Debian base system.
* **xorriso/squashfs-tools**: build the final ISO.

---

### 🧩 2. Start a base configuration

Create a working directory and initialize live-build:

```bash
mkdir ~/debian-fork
cd ~/debian-fork
lb config --debian-installer live --debian-installer-gui true --distribution bookworm --archive-areas "main contrib non-free non-free-firmware"
```

You can later tweak this by editing the configuration files under `config/`.

---

### 🎨 3. Add custom packages and desktop (like KDE)

To include KDE (Plasma desktop), add package lists:

```bash
echo "task-kde-desktop" > config/package-lists/desktop.list.chroot
```

You can also include other software you want preinstalled:

```bash
echo "firefox-esr konsole kate" >> config/package-lists/desktop.list.chroot
```

---

### ⚙️ 4. Customize KDE and system defaults

To apply your own OOBE and configuration defaults:

1. **User configs** → Place them under
   `config/includes.chroot/etc/skel/`
   Everything inside this directory becomes the default user home on first boot.

   Example:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p config/includes.chroot/etc/skel/.config
   cp -r ~/.config/kde.org config/includes.chroot/etc/skel/.config/
   ```

   Or set Plasma defaults via `.config/plasmarc`, `.config/kdeglobals`, etc.

2. **Global system settings** → Use:

   ```
   config/includes.chroot/etc/
   ```

   For example, to modify `/etc/issue`, network configs, autologin settings, etc.

3. **Branding / OOBE** → You can use a custom first-run script:

   ```
   config/hooks/live/9999-oobe.hook.chroot
   ```

   Example script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Custom OOBE actions
   echo "Welcome to LeiOS!" > /etc/motd
   ```

   Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x config/hooks/live/9999-oobe.hook.chroot
   ```

---

### 💄 5. Optional: Add your own branding

For example, replace KDE wallpapers or themes:

```
config/includes.chroot/usr/share/wallpapers/
config/includes.chroot/usr/share/sddm/themes/
```

You can also change `/etc/os-release` to show your custom distro name.

---

### 🏗️ 6. Build the ISO

Finally, build your custom Debian image:

```bash
sudo lb build
```

This takes a while.
When done, you’ll get something like:

```
live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso
```

You can boot or install it just like a normal Debian ISO — but with all your OOBE and settings in place.

---

### 🚀 7. Advanced options (optional)

If you want to go further:

* **Create your own repository** (e.g., `deb https://repo.leios.net bookworm main`) for updates or custom packages.
* **Use Calamares** (the installer framework used by KDE neon and EndeavourOS) for a more polished installer experience.
* **Automate post-install OOBE** with `systemd --user` scripts or first-login scripts in `/etc/profile.d/`.

---

Would you like me to show you how to integrate **Calamares** and make it look like a modern polished OOBE (like KDE neon or Pop!_OS)? That’s a nice next step if you want your distro to feel “official.”
